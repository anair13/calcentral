<description>A monument at the southwest corner of Hearst Ave. and Gayley Rd. marks the spot where trustees of the College of California gathered on April 16, 1860, to dedicate a new campus for higher learning. Eight years later the institution merged with the new state-chartered Agricultural, Mining and Mechanical Arts College to form the University of California; the first classes were held on the Berkeley campus in 1873.</description>

<description><![CDATA[Named for pioneer California banker Peder Sather, the gate used to mark the formal south entrance to campus (until campus expanded down to Bancroft Way). It remains a popular spot for leafleting and politicking. Atop the gate are eight panels of bas-relief figures, with four nude men representing the disciplines of law, letters, medicine, and mining, and four nude women representing agriculture, architecture, art, and electricity. When the panels were first installed, public outrage led Sather to request their removal; 67 years later, the figures were rediscovered and reinstalled. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.]]></description>
