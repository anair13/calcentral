<summary>Grinnell Natural Area</summary>
<description>This grove, planted more than a century ago on the north bank of Strawberry Creek, began life as a windbreak for a running track located where the Life Sciences Addition now stands. The blue gum eucalyptus, some reaching nearly 200 feet high, are thought to be the tallest stand of hardwood trees in North America. Across Strawberry Creek to the south lies the Grinnell Natural Area, where stands of redwood, Monterey pine and coast live oak give an idea of what this land looked like before the arrival of campus. It is named for the first director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, professor Joseph Grinnell.</description>

Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

<description>Part of John Galen Howard's original campus design, the glade had been overwhelmed by ugly "temporary" buildings constructed during World War II. Construction of the library's underground Gardner Stacks and removal of the temporary structures allowed the creation of this major green open space, conducive to personal reflection and informal leisure activities. At the northwest corner of the glade is a memorial pool honoring members of the campus community who lost their lives in World War II.</description>

<description>This peaceful preserve, marked by wooden bridges crossing a meandering fork of Strawberry Creek, was dedicated in 1969 in honor of Edward Wickson, dean of the College of Agriculture from 1906-1912. It includes some of the oldest trees on campus, including a stand of coast redwoods dating from the 1870s, and a magnificent Chinese gingko planted in 1881.</description>

Obscured during several years of construction in the area, as the mining building was renovated and Stanley Hall was built, the well-loved Berkeley gathering spot is being restored to its original prominence, a priority of the campus's Landscape Master Plan.</description>

<description>This rise just west of McCone Hall was the site of the Students' Observatory, built in 1885 to house a variety of astronomical instruments, including a 20" telescope. Two years later, the observatory added the first seismographic equipment deployed by the University of California, and in 1891 a glass conservatory was built on the hill as part of the original campus botanical garden. The conservatory was razed in 1924; the observatory moved to Lafayette in 1965. The site is now an open space for relaxing or studying, bordered on its south flank by the new C.V. Starr East Asian Library and Chang-Lin Tien Center for East Asian Studies.</description>
